A collection of the Shiny Apps I have made:

1. `approximating_pi` is an app that uses Monte Carlo methods to give an accesible visual introduction to numerical 
integration. The actual app can be found at:  https://apapiu.shinyapps.io/approximating_pi/

2. `overfit` is a work in progress that lets the user pick certain parameters like degree of fit and regularization constans for a 
given random noisy data set. The user then gets a plot of how their models did. I have found it very useful in understanding overfitting 
and different levels of regularization. 

3. `baby_names` is also a work in progress. It look at the social security data on names of babies born since 1880 and plots various trends based on name input.
